## Sep 3 2025

- Started working on schema
- I didnt know how to approach this, failed in 2022.
- Started from the most simple thing (physical item)
- I wasnt sure how to approach date functions but I decided, that starting
with order, equipment_type and equipment tables would be wise. I stated
with table that didnt have any foreign keys / relationships.

- Sorry, I started with equipment type - right in the middle.
